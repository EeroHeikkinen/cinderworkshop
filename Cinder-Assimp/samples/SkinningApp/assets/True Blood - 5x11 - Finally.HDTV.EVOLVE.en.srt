1
00:00:01,578 --> 00:00:04,454
The true death will come very soon
if you do not accept Lilith.

2
00:00:04,488 --> 00:00:05,923
Lilith is a godless god.

3
00:00:06,158 --> 00:00:08,728
<i>She will lead you and all</i>
<i>around you to destruction.</i>

4
00:00:08,762 --> 00:00:10,932
- Alaska?
- I'll be there next week.

5
00:00:10,966 --> 00:00:14,240
I want you to glamour me.
Make me forget about you.

6
00:00:14,274 --> 00:00:16,976
- I want him gone, too.
- Goodbye, Hoyt.

7
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:19,314
<i>Tonight, live from</i>
<i>New Orleans, Louisiana,</i>

8
00:00:19,348 --> 00:00:20,915
<i>Reverend Steve Newlin.</i>

9
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,119
He's in the state.
We have to go.

10
00:00:23,153 --> 00:00:24,857
He probably left
for somewhere.

11
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:28,762
You know that Daddy doesn't
like it when you're human.

12
00:00:28,797 --> 00:00:31,164
So what, then? You let Elijah take
everything from you?

13
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:34,036
We live in the wind
just like I did with Eric.

14
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,042
We're not running.

15
00:00:38,076 --> 00:00:40,344
I lost Packmaster.
I've been abjured.

16
00:00:41,947 --> 00:00:44,850
You're a lone wolf now,
just like your old man.

17
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:47,754
Lilith came to me
and she destroyed my maker

18
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,090
<i>whom I was worshipping</i>
<i>as a false god.</i>

19
00:00:50,124 --> 00:00:51,326
We are the children
of Lilith.

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,796
<i>You'll see that you and I</i>

21
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,132
were meant to lead
our kind into the coming age.

22
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,767
What coming age?

23
00:00:57,802 --> 00:01:01,939
The blood of the fae
allows us to daywalk.

24
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:04,008
We are of the night.

25
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:06,545
I can put you
back in the ground.

26
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:09,815
<i>You can have your Lilith.</i>

27
00:01:09,849 --> 00:01:12,986
I will have the sun!

28
00:01:14,222 --> 00:01:15,622
Where did you get this?

29
00:01:15,656 --> 00:01:17,657
<i>Underneath the floorboards</i>
<i>in my gran's house.</i>

30
00:01:17,692 --> 00:01:19,192
It's a contract

31
00:01:19,226 --> 00:01:21,995
"I, John William Stackhouse

32
00:01:22,029 --> 00:01:24,197
grant Mr. M. Warlow

33
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:27,166
my first fae-bearing
female heir."

34
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:29,469
Sookie.

35
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:44,521
<i>Bill Compton.</i>

36
00:01:57,337 --> 00:02:02,074

00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:09,848
<i>Bill...</i>

38
00:02:12,118 --> 00:02:14,286
<i>Compton.</i>

39
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,484
Only one can lead us.

40
00:02:42,518 --> 00:02:44,519
I choose you.

41
00:02:56,534 --> 00:02:58,602
Drink the blood.

42
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,270
Drink it all.

43
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:11,717
No.

44
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:14,954
No.

She will lead you and all
around you to destruction.

61
00:05:18,314 --> 00:05:21,449
<i>If you kill and kill,</i>

63
00:05:23,286 --> 00:05:25,586
- No!
- Father!

64
00:05:27,055 --> 00:05:29,491
General Cavanaugh
is coming.

65
00:05:29,525 --> 00:05:30,859
Nora?

66
00:05:30,893 --> 00:05:32,294
Yes?

67
00:05:32,328 --> 00:05:34,329
We've received word
that General Cavanaugh

68
00:05:34,363 --> 00:05:36,231
<i>will be paying us a visit.</i>

69
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:38,366
- Sorry.
- Are you all right?

70
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,635
Yes, I'm fine.

71
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:44,105
Something's different.
You've changed.

72
00:05:45,507 --> 00:05:48,343
- Are you having doubts?
- No. No, of course not.

73
00:05:49,244 --> 00:05:50,878
I'm worried about Russell.

74
00:05:50,913 --> 00:05:54,115
His recklessness could destroy
everything we've worked for.

75
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,184
Russell's inconsequential.

76
00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:58,186
He's nothing.

77
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:00,021
This is all part
of Lilith's plan.

78
00:06:00,056 --> 00:06:01,957
Yes, of course.

79
00:06:01,992 --> 00:06:04,961
We started this together,
you and I.

80
00:06:04,995 --> 00:06:08,765
And now everything we've
dreamed of is coming to pass.

81
00:06:10,301 --> 00:06:13,603
- The world will run with blood.
- Yes.

82
00:06:13,638 --> 00:06:17,307
And we'll be there
to drink it down.

83
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:19,977
And in the darkness
we shall rejoice.

84
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:36,327
- I'll let the others know.
- Yeah. Go.

85
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,045
<i>Jessica.</i>

86
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,281
Hey, Bill. I was wondering
if I could use your phone.

87
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:59,885
- Mine doesn't work down here.
- For what purpose?

88
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,387
I've got to warn Jason.

89
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,475
When you were gone,
I had to stop Steve Newlin

90
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,791
from attacking him twice.

91
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:09,728
And now that Russell
and him are on the loose,

92
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,330
I'm really afraid
he's gonna do it again.

93
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,799
- So can I use it?
- I'm sorry, but no.

94
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,069
No?

95
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,139
But Jason is out there.
He's a sitting duck.

96
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,874
Sookie, too.

97
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:25,511
Jessica, it has taken me
a long while to come to terms

98
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,881
with the fact that part of
accepting the word of Lilith

99
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,984
into my heart has been
distancing myself

100
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,886
from the trivial
matters of humans.

101
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,021
It used to drive me crazy

102
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,924
worrying about their feelings
and their mortality

103
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,492
and their weakness

104
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,862
until I found
a better way--

105
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,263
Lilith's way.

106
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:47,999
And Jason and Sookie and
the inhabitants of Bon Temps

107
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:49,700
are no longer
our concern.

108
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,303
They are food
and nothing more.

109
00:07:52,337 --> 00:07:54,305
You can't mean that.

110
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:57,107
You will see in time.

111
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:58,542
Now, I'm sorry,

112
00:07:58,576 --> 00:08:01,045
but I have other matters
that I have to attend to.

113
00:08:02,814 --> 00:08:05,582
But what if I made
him a vampire?

114
00:08:07,518 --> 00:08:09,786
You want to be a maker?

115
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,787
I was--

116
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:13,289
I was reading
the Book of Lilith

117
00:08:13,323 --> 00:08:15,258
and it says
that the greatest gift

118
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:18,161
you can give a human
is to make them a vampire.

119
00:08:18,195 --> 00:08:20,396
That is true.

120
00:08:20,431 --> 00:08:22,932
Well, that makes sense to me
because I love Jason,

121
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:24,601
but it never seems
to work out with him.

122
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:27,170
And I was thinking that's
probably because he's a human

123
00:08:27,204 --> 00:08:29,373
<i>and I'm a vampire.</i>

124
00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:33,143
But if I made him a vampire,
then we can be together.

125
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,281
You know, blessed
by Lilith.

126
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,686
Do you think
I'm an idiot?

127
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,120
What?

128
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:47,190
Are you really gonna stand there
and try and manipulate me

129
00:08:47,225 --> 00:08:49,660
with your foolish lies?

130
00:08:50,461 --> 00:08:52,797
- I'm not.
- Yes.

131
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:55,266
Please, can you send in
Gondry and Lambert?

132
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,768
What are you doing?

133
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:59,571
I'm taking you up
on your generous offer.

134
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:02,374
If you want to make
Jason Stackhouse into a vampire,

135
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,176
then by all means,
please do so.

136
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,978
No, Bill, I wasn't trying
to manipulate you.

137
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,146
No, no, no.
You're right.

138
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,649
In the time to come,

139
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,985
it may be important for me to
bolster the Compton bloodline.

140
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,921
So why not start right now?

141
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,390
As you rightly said,
as chancellor,

142
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,493
it would be hypocritical
of me to demand

143
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,328
that vampires
become makers

144
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:25,332
without requiring
the same thing of you.

145
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:27,534
- Wait, Bill.
- Gondry.

146
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,536
This is my progeny
Jessica.

147
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,371
I want you to take
her to Bon Temps

148
00:09:31,406 --> 00:09:34,942
where she is gonna sire a young
man named Jason Stackhouse.

149
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:37,411
Take the helicopter.
I want this thing done properly.

150
00:09:37,445 --> 00:09:40,347
- No, I don't need to, Bill.
- Don't let her out of your sight.

151
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,517
Forgive me. Forgive me.
Forgive me. Forgive me.

152
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:32,625
What are we going to do?

153
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:35,928
I'll get us out of here.

154
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,371
You gonna be okay?

155
00:11:44,406 --> 00:11:46,173
Kinda strange to find out

156
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,143
you were sold to a vampire
300 years ago.

157
00:11:49,177 --> 00:11:51,646
Hey, that scroll thing
is bullshit.

158
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,615
I don't care what it says,
ain't nobody selling you.

159
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,151
Not on my watch.

160
00:11:57,186 --> 00:11:59,821
I think he came for me.

161
00:11:59,855 --> 00:12:02,790
- What are you talking about?
- Except he wasn't a vampire.

162
00:12:02,825 --> 00:12:06,428
He was this weird air shape.

163
00:12:06,462 --> 00:12:08,897
He said, "You are mine."

164
00:12:10,801 --> 00:12:12,535
Well, that is...

165
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:14,203
really fucking creepy.

166
00:12:16,306 --> 00:12:20,141
Maurella, she said talking
to this Elder person,

167
00:12:20,176 --> 00:12:21,643
that could give us
some answers.

168
00:12:21,677 --> 00:12:23,978
She said
it's worth a shot.

169
00:12:25,881 --> 00:12:28,683
Oh, Sook.
Come here.

170
00:12:31,287 --> 00:12:32,887
I've got to go.

171
00:12:32,922 --> 00:12:36,224
Andy's got us doing triple shifts
with all these vamp attacks.

172
00:12:36,258 --> 00:12:38,926
I'll come back tomorrow
and check up on you.

173
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:40,995
You stay here
where it's nice and safe.

174
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:43,597
Okay.

175
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:45,403
I just need your help
to get me out of here.

176
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:46,628
Oh.

177
00:12:48,837 --> 00:12:50,772
Jason, promise me
you'll be careful.

178
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,841
Whoa.

179
00:12:53,876 --> 00:12:55,744
Never gonna get
used to that.

180
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:32,379
Sir.
This way.

181
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:35,481
We'll be standing by
right here, sir.

182
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,217
Mm-hmm.

183
00:13:55,337 --> 00:13:58,573
General Cavanaugh.
What a surprise.

184
00:13:58,607 --> 00:14:01,476
So nice
to see you again.

185
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,077
Cut the crap,
Chancellor.

186
00:14:03,112 --> 00:14:06,047
Where's Roman?

187
00:14:06,082 --> 00:14:09,184
Unfortunately, the Guardian
is unavailable at this time.

188
00:14:09,218 --> 00:14:10,719
Who the fuck are you?

189
00:14:10,753 --> 00:14:14,022
General, this is
Chancellor Compton.

190
00:14:14,056 --> 00:14:15,590
He's new.

191
00:14:15,624 --> 00:14:18,059
Well, there's
a shit-storm out there

192
00:14:18,093 --> 00:14:19,761
and Roman's been
ducking my calls.

193
00:14:19,796 --> 00:14:21,796
Now I demand to know
what's going on.

194
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,165
Well, you're not in a position
to be making demands.

195
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,401
Oh, I see.
And who the fuck are you?

196
00:14:26,435 --> 00:14:29,104
General Cavanaugh, we deeply
regret that Roman's not here,

197
00:14:29,138 --> 00:14:30,739
but can we do anything
to help you?

198
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:33,542
We know you bombed
the Tru Blood factories.

199
00:14:33,576 --> 00:14:37,045
That is absurd. Those factories
were bombed by terrorists.

200
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,881
Don't bullshit
a bullshitter, Rosalyn.

201
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,083
The US government and this
Authority have an arrangement.

202
00:14:42,118 --> 00:14:44,419
The arrangement
is called mainstreaming.

203
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:47,722
It means you don't fuck with us,
we don't fuck with you.

204
00:14:47,757 --> 00:14:49,241
Now, I've been working
with Roman to protect this

205
00:14:49,266 --> 00:14:50,892
Authority for 20 years.

206
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:52,561
But this time
you've gone too far.

207
00:14:52,595 --> 00:14:54,796
There are high-level talks
at the Pentagon right now

208
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,732
<i>about how to eradicate vampires</i>
<i>from the face of the planet.</i>

209
00:14:57,766 --> 00:15:01,202
So I need to speak
with Roman.

210
00:15:07,342 --> 00:15:10,077
Roman is no longer with us.

211
00:15:11,146 --> 00:15:12,747
How?

212
00:15:12,782 --> 00:15:15,751
He couldn't get with
the program, so he had to go.

213
00:15:15,785 --> 00:15:18,286
<i>This is a Sanguinist</i>
<i>regime now.</i>

214
00:15:18,321 --> 00:15:20,355
Lilith has guided us
to our rightful place,

215
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,457
and there we shall lead
all vampire-kind.

216
00:15:22,492 --> 00:15:25,561
I would advise
you to be...

217
00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:27,329
careful

218
00:15:27,363 --> 00:15:29,731
about what words
you choose next.

219
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,667
You psychotic bloodsuckers.

220
00:15:34,137 --> 00:15:35,970
Roman was the only one
keeping a lid on this.

221
00:15:36,005 --> 00:15:37,438
He was the only one
stopping the world

222
00:15:37,473 --> 00:15:40,041
from sliding back
into the Dark Ages.

223
00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:43,377
Roman was an infidel
who defied the word of Lilith.

224
00:15:44,613 --> 00:15:46,514
And now he's gone.

225
00:15:46,548 --> 00:15:49,850
You strike me as a man of integrity,
General Cavanaugh.

226
00:15:49,885 --> 00:15:51,752
Also a pragmatist.

227
00:15:51,787 --> 00:15:55,489
Now this is the situation
that we find ourselves in.

228
00:15:55,524 --> 00:15:58,158
You can join us or not.

229
00:15:58,192 --> 00:16:01,929
I sincerely hope that you
choose the path forward.

230
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:08,068
We have video

231
00:16:08,102 --> 00:16:10,304
of Russell Edgington
and Steve Newlin

232
00:16:10,338 --> 00:16:12,707
<i>eviscerating 22</i>
<i>fraternity brothers</i>

233
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:16,211
<i>at the local Gamma Kappa Tau</i>
<i>house last night.</i>

234
00:16:19,015 --> 00:16:20,916
There are copies of this.

235
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,818
If anything happens to me
now or in the future,

236
00:16:22,852 --> 00:16:24,720
this is gonna be released
to the public.

237
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:29,591
You assured the world,
you assured the president

238
00:16:29,626 --> 00:16:32,561
that Russell Edgington
was dead, and you lied.

239
00:16:32,595 --> 00:16:34,763
So if that video
goes viral,

240
00:16:34,797 --> 00:16:37,132
the human population is gonna
rise up against vampires

241
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,101
faster than you can say
"Molotov cocktail."

242
00:16:39,135 --> 00:16:41,169
Your threats
are empty, General.

243
00:16:41,203 --> 00:16:43,104
Are you really
that stupid?

244
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:44,939
We're prepared.

245
00:16:44,974 --> 00:16:47,208
You don't think we've been planning
for this? We have weapons.

246
00:16:47,242 --> 00:16:49,677
<i>Weapons you have never</i>
<i>heard of.</i>

247
00:16:49,711 --> 00:16:51,879
We own the day.

248
00:16:51,913 --> 00:16:54,781
<i>Vampires don't stand</i>
<i>a fucking chance.</i>

249
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:57,618
Now there's only one person
standing between you

250
00:16:57,652 --> 00:17:00,154
and all-out war with the humans,
and you're looking at him.

251
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:03,257
So I suggest you think
very carefully

252
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,860
about what <i>you</i> say next.

253
00:17:17,774 --> 00:17:19,241
That's what I thought.

254
00:17:23,013 --> 00:17:24,780
Oh, God.

255
00:17:24,815 --> 00:17:27,883
God is a vampire.

256
00:17:28,986 --> 00:17:30,319
Oh, my.

257
00:17:41,432 --> 00:17:42,699
Hi, Jason.

258
00:17:43,601 --> 00:17:45,168
Jess.

259
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:48,138
What's going on?
Who are these guys?

260
00:17:48,172 --> 00:17:50,507
Um...

261
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,941
Hey, guys,

262
00:17:51,976 --> 00:17:55,011
you're kind of cramping my style.
Do you mind?

263
00:17:55,046 --> 00:17:56,679
Your maker told me
to supervise,

264
00:17:56,714 --> 00:17:59,649
so that's what I'm going to do--
supervise.

265
00:17:59,683 --> 00:18:02,118
Okay.

266
00:18:02,152 --> 00:18:03,986
Um...

267
00:18:04,054 --> 00:18:05,488
Jason,

268
00:18:05,522 --> 00:18:08,157
we've been through
a lot together,

269
00:18:08,192 --> 00:18:09,959
and I think through
all of that, you know,

270
00:18:09,993 --> 00:18:12,995
we've learned we can
trust each other.

271
00:18:13,063 --> 00:18:14,597
I don't know about that.

272
00:18:14,631 --> 00:18:16,833
It's kind of been
one of our issues.

273
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:18,801
- Just saying.
- Yeah, I know.

274
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:21,103
But I think you know
that you can trust me.

275
00:18:21,137 --> 00:18:25,207
And I know
that I can trust you

276
00:18:25,241 --> 00:18:27,709
to do the right thing.

277
00:18:27,743 --> 00:18:31,512
Well, that's another thing--
we never do the right thing.

278
00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:33,955
The right thing would be
not sleeping with each other

279
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,382
behind Hoyt's back.

280
00:18:35,383 --> 00:18:38,018
You, me, we try
to be good people,

281
00:18:38,052 --> 00:18:39,586
- but that don't mean that we are.
- Jason--

282
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:42,789
This is getting tiresome. We need
to get you two in the ground.

283
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:44,959
Let me do this.

284
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:47,261
If you don't do it,
I will.

285
00:18:47,295 --> 00:18:48,963
What the hell
is he talking about?

286
00:18:50,265 --> 00:18:52,700
Jess!

287
00:18:53,735 --> 00:18:55,369
Fuck it.

288
00:18:57,206 --> 00:18:59,374
Trust me.

289
00:18:59,408 --> 00:19:01,209
No!

290
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:04,145
Oh, fuck!

291
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,448
You fucking idiot.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

292
00:19:07,483 --> 00:19:09,451
Do you have any idea
what you have done?

293
00:19:09,485 --> 00:19:10,338
He was a dick.

294
00:19:10,363 --> 00:19:12,320
I'm glad he killed
the bloated windbag.

295
00:19:12,321 --> 00:19:13,855
They have weapons.
Now we're vulnerable.

296
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:15,723
- He was bluffing.
- You're all missing the point.

297
00:19:15,758 --> 00:19:17,625
I'm just saying I have known
this rattlesnake.

298
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,394
- I knew his family.
- Shut up, Rosalyn!

299
00:19:19,428 --> 00:19:21,796
- We need to clear this up.
- What do we do?

300
00:19:21,831 --> 00:19:24,232
Listen!

301
00:19:24,267 --> 00:19:26,134
I admit, I might have been
a bit impulsive here,

302
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:28,203
but I can fix this.

303
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,905
I'll go on
a glamouring campaign,

304
00:19:29,939 --> 00:19:33,008
eliminate all memory
that the video exists.

305
00:19:33,042 --> 00:19:34,443
It'll be like none
of this ever happened.

306
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:36,779
Yes, and I know
the general's chief of staff.

307
00:19:36,813 --> 00:19:38,748
If we act quickly, we can
contain the situation.

308
00:19:38,782 --> 00:19:40,249
Okay, go.
Take the AVL jet

309
00:19:40,284 --> 00:19:42,485
and report back
when it is done.

310
00:19:44,388 --> 00:19:46,857
Take a security detail.

311
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:49,192
Might need the backup.

312
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:51,762
Of course.

313
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:56,934
I'll handle
the general's entourage.

314
00:20:03,142 --> 00:20:05,610
Baby, I am so sorry.

315
00:20:05,644 --> 00:20:07,845
It's gonna be okay,

316
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:10,047
'cause you're gonna
wake up a vampire.

317
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,950
You shouldn't cry,
little girl.

318
00:20:12,985 --> 00:20:16,354
This is a happy day.

319
00:20:16,422 --> 00:20:18,656
When you and Prince Charming
wake tomorrow night,

320
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,226
he can bite you
right back.

321
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:24,028
Should we pick up some
takeout on our way back?

322
00:20:24,062 --> 00:20:25,796
Do it.

323
00:20:30,236 --> 00:20:32,570
- Fuck!
- I'm sorry.

324
00:20:32,605 --> 00:20:34,539
- Fuck!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

325
00:20:34,574 --> 00:20:36,174
I tried not to drink
too much of your blood.

326
00:20:36,242 --> 00:20:37,142
Why?

327
00:20:37,176 --> 00:20:39,211
Russell Edgington
and Steve Newlin,

328
00:20:39,245 --> 00:20:41,532
they are coming for Sookie,
and Bill and Eric have gone

329
00:20:41,557 --> 00:20:42,815
crazy on vampire religion

330
00:20:42,816 --> 00:20:44,584
and nobody is gonna
save her this time.

331
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,054
- Oh, Jesus.
- Wait, Jason.

332
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:51,091
- What?
- I know this wasn't real.

333
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:53,694
But if I was gonna have to
spend eternity with somebody--

334
00:20:53,728 --> 00:20:56,763
I mean...

335
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,266
I wasn't faking
that part.

336
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:02,201
I've got to go
warn Sookie.

337
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,846
We cleaned it all up.

338
00:21:13,881 --> 00:21:15,415
There's not a drop
of Elijah anywhere.

339
00:21:15,449 --> 00:21:17,650
I went over this place
with a toothbrush.

340
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:22,921
Killing a sheriff--
this is going to go up the chain.

341
00:21:22,955 --> 00:21:25,557
- What chain?
- The fucking Authority.

342
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,025
What's the damn
Authority?

343
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:28,927
It's our government
and church combined.

344
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:30,461
The church runs
the government.

345
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:33,564
- Like the Vatican?
- Kind of.

346
00:21:33,632 --> 00:21:36,533
They hand down the laws
and we follow them.

347
00:21:36,568 --> 00:21:38,135
It's how it works.

348
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,637
Well, the Pope can fuck me
and so can the Authority.

349
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:41,405
They can both keep
their laws off of my body.

350
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:44,975
The Authority can do
whatever they want

351
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:48,979
with you and your body.

352
00:21:49,013 --> 00:21:51,215
We're not going to talk
about this ever again.

353
00:21:51,249 --> 00:21:54,451
- But do you think--
- For fuck's sake, Tara.

354
00:21:54,485 --> 00:21:57,054
As your maker, I command
you to never speak

355
00:21:57,088 --> 00:22:00,757
of Sheriff Stormer
and his untimely true death.

356
00:22:09,034 --> 00:22:10,968
- Oh, hey.
- What the hell happened to you?

357
00:22:11,002 --> 00:22:13,237
- I need you to hide me.
- No.

358
00:22:13,271 --> 00:22:14,739
Why not?

359
00:22:14,773 --> 00:22:16,641
Since when did I become
a halfway house

360
00:22:16,675 --> 00:22:18,476
for wayward baby vamps?

361
00:22:18,511 --> 00:22:20,479
Whatever trouble you're in,
leave me out of it.

362
00:22:20,513 --> 00:22:22,414
I got enough of my own.

363
00:22:25,318 --> 00:22:27,086
I know where Eric is.

364
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:34,327
- Where?
- I'll tell you if you hide me.

365
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:39,332
Don't play games with me,
you little ginger bitch.

366
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:41,734
Hide me.

367
00:22:47,173 --> 00:22:49,641
Get her a coffin
out of storage.

368
00:22:52,078 --> 00:22:55,012
Answers, now.

369
00:23:03,355 --> 00:23:06,590
<i>And despite what AVL</i>

376

<i>Security protocols initiated.</i>

379
00:24:10,921 --> 00:24:13,456
Where the hell are we?

380
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,692
- I think we're underground.
- What is this place?

381
00:24:16,726 --> 00:24:19,662
A fucking vampire
secret headquarters?

382
00:24:19,697 --> 00:24:23,199
Emma's here somewhere.

383
00:24:29,172 --> 00:24:32,174
Remember, it is truly
a great honor to meet the Elder.

384
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:33,442
Who is she, exactly?

385
00:24:33,477 --> 00:24:35,544
She's the oldest fairy
to escape through the portal.

386
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:38,547
- There's only one problem.
- It's not a problem.

387
00:24:38,582 --> 00:24:40,482
The Elder has been
through so many realms,

388
00:24:40,517 --> 00:24:43,886
she's assumed so many shapes and
spoken so many languages

389
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,255
that she sometimes
has a difficult time...

390
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:48,123
- focusing.
- Focusing?

391
00:24:48,158 --> 00:24:50,760
She operates on
many frequencies at once.

392
00:24:50,794 --> 00:24:52,462
Time has
no meaning for her.

393
00:24:52,496 --> 00:24:53,830
But you think
she can help me?

394
00:24:53,864 --> 00:24:55,765
We shall see.

395
00:25:00,905 --> 00:25:02,205
Your Grace.

396
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:03,840
This is Sookie Stackhouse,

397
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:05,776
the halfling
you were told about.

398
00:25:07,378 --> 00:25:09,313
Ke$ha-- for or against?

399
00:25:09,347 --> 00:25:11,381
Excuse me?

400
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:14,552
- Do you like her music?
- I'm sorry.

401
00:25:14,586 --> 00:25:16,287
I'm not that familiar
with her music.

402
00:25:16,321 --> 00:25:18,322
She doesn't really sing,
does she?

403
00:25:18,357 --> 00:25:20,058
She talks.

404
00:25:20,092 --> 00:25:22,761
I suppose that makes her
some sort of a poet.

405
00:25:22,795 --> 00:25:26,431
That's alarming because
her spelling is atrocious.

406
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:28,968
Ha! Leave us.

407
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:35,041
Begging your pardon,
Miss Elder.

408
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:38,111
Maurella said that you might know
my great-great-great,

409
00:25:38,145 --> 00:25:41,881
like, times 15 grandfather
John Stackhouse.

410
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,150
Johnny Stackhouse?

411
00:25:45,185 --> 00:25:47,753
Yes, I did know him.

412
00:25:48,855 --> 00:25:51,356
He was a landowner.
Very handsome.

413
00:25:51,391 --> 00:25:53,425
Bit of a creep.
No offense.

414
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,861
None taken.

415
00:25:55,895 --> 00:25:57,729
Do you know why he might
have promised me

416
00:25:57,763 --> 00:25:59,965
to a vampire named Warlow?

417
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:01,866
It is forbidden to speak
of these things.

418
00:26:01,901 --> 00:26:04,602
- What things?
- John Cougar Mellencamp, for or against?

419
00:26:04,636 --> 00:26:06,070
Against.
What things?

420
00:26:06,105 --> 00:26:09,373
Look, there is a reason

421
00:26:09,408 --> 00:26:12,110
that you find
vampires irresistible,

422
00:26:12,144 --> 00:26:14,579
a reason that you
slut your heart out

423
00:26:14,613 --> 00:26:16,547
to every cute guy
out there with fangs.

424
00:26:16,615 --> 00:26:19,550
- I beg your pardon?
- You, me, Warlow--

425
00:26:19,585 --> 00:26:21,285
our destinies
are entwined.

426
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,721
Yes, okay, but what
is that supposed to mean?

427
00:26:23,755 --> 00:26:27,491
A dark time is coming.
You will be tested.

428
00:26:27,525 --> 00:26:29,626
Hold on to your light.

429
00:26:29,661 --> 00:26:34,064
As long as we fairies
control our light,

430
00:26:34,098 --> 00:26:36,233
we will be free.

431
00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:39,837
Boyz II Men, for or against?

432
00:26:39,871 --> 00:26:42,539
For. I'm sorry, I know you have
trouble with frequencies,

433
00:26:42,574 --> 00:26:45,109
but there's a creepy
vampire ghost air monster

434
00:26:45,144 --> 00:26:47,946
who killed my parents
and now he's coming to get me

435
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,382
and I really need you
to give me something concrete,

436
00:26:50,417 --> 00:26:51,917
something useful.

437
00:26:51,952 --> 00:26:54,086
My apologies.

438
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:56,155
There's so much information
in my head.

439
00:26:56,189 --> 00:26:57,890
Eons of data.

440
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,261
Warlow is very--

441
00:27:02,295 --> 00:27:05,097
<i>Sookie!</i>

442
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,331
<i>Sook!</i>
<i>I've got to talk to you!</i>

443
00:27:06,366 --> 00:27:08,734
- Jason.
- <i>Let me in!</i>

444
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,573
- Where is she?
- He's been bitten.

445
00:27:14,607 --> 00:27:16,141
We got to hide you
right now.

446
00:27:16,175 --> 00:27:17,542
Oh, my God. What happened to you?
Are you okay?

447
00:27:17,577 --> 00:27:20,045
Forget this. Russell Edgington
and Steve Newlin,

448
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:22,847
they're coming for you.
Bill, Eric, they've both gone crazy.

449
00:27:22,882 --> 00:27:25,784
They found vampire religion,
so nobody's coming to save you.

450
00:27:25,818 --> 00:27:27,386
Russell Edgington is alive?

451
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,289
- Yeah.
- Please, Miss Elder, you said Warlow is...?

452
00:27:30,323 --> 00:27:32,557
Russell Edgington
is alive?

453
00:27:37,997 --> 00:27:39,197
Hey there, sunshine.

454
00:27:39,232 --> 00:27:42,267
Good morning,
Sheriff Bellefleur.

455
00:27:42,301 --> 00:27:44,436
Egg sandwich,
crispy bacon,

456
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:47,005
large coffee,
extra milk, extra sugar.

457
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,274
You're so sweet, you make
the food here taste good.

458
00:27:51,443 --> 00:27:53,244
I got a little
something else for you.

459
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:55,113
Come here.

460
00:27:59,485 --> 00:28:01,386
My boys here

461
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,123
have something they want
to say to you.

462
00:28:04,157 --> 00:28:06,225
Uh, hey,
Sheriff Bellefleur.

463
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:09,495
Uh, I just want to say
that I'm sorry

464
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:11,665
for putting your butt
up on Facebook.

465
00:28:11,699 --> 00:28:14,768
Uh, it was wrong

466
00:28:14,802 --> 00:28:17,938
and it seems like you're
making my mom real happy.

467
00:28:17,972 --> 00:28:20,808
<i>You know, way happier</i>
<i>than my pops ever did.</i>

468
00:28:20,842 --> 00:28:23,744
So, sorry.

469
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,715
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

470
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:29,917
Sorry that I cannot scrape
the image of your ass

471
00:28:29,952 --> 00:28:31,786
- from the back wall of my mind.
- Rocky.

472
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,689
Sorry I'm gonna have to waste all
of my mama's hard-earned tips

473
00:28:34,723 --> 00:28:37,692
to pay for years of therapy and
probably end up incarcerated anyway.

474
00:28:37,726 --> 00:28:39,794
Rocky Cleary, you quit
your sass right now.

475
00:28:39,828 --> 00:28:41,896
You can't make me say
stuff that I don't feel.

476
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,065
It's all right, Holly.

477
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:47,435
He's got no reason
to trust me.

478
00:28:47,469 --> 00:28:49,436
Yet.

479
00:28:51,373 --> 00:28:54,408
But I'm gonna make
you boys a promise.

480
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:58,446
I am gonna do right
by your mama

481
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,248
for as long
as she'll have me.

482
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,017
You can take that
to the bank.

483
00:29:03,051 --> 00:29:05,419
Banks suck.
They took our house.

484
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:08,022
It's a figure
of speech, son.

485
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,393
What do you say?

486
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:17,631
Come on.

487
00:29:22,837 --> 00:29:24,504
All right.

488
00:29:27,941 --> 00:29:30,376
No, that's all right.
Okay.

489
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,411
All righty, then.

490
00:29:35,115 --> 00:29:36,482
I'll see you at lunch.

491
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,764
Jackson.

492
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:54,401
Alcide, look at you.

493
00:29:54,435 --> 00:29:56,170
Ain't seen you
since you was a pup.

494
00:29:56,237 --> 00:29:58,071
Mr. Rollins.

495
00:29:58,106 --> 00:29:59,740
What do you want?

496
00:29:59,774 --> 00:30:01,575
Just out warning folks.

497
00:30:01,609 --> 00:30:03,878
There's been a bunch
of baby vamp attacks

498
00:30:03,912 --> 00:30:05,613
in Madison
and Rankin Counties.

499
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:08,549
<i>Kills are messy, savage.</i>

500
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:10,818
<i>We think the vamps</i>
<i>are upping their numbers,</i>

501
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:14,388
turning folks,
letting them run wild.

502
00:30:14,423 --> 00:30:17,525
Baby vamps are forming
into packs, hunting.

503
00:30:17,593 --> 00:30:19,661
Coming our way.

504
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:21,696
Silver-plated
box fence.

505
00:30:21,731 --> 00:30:23,298
Won't stop
the grown vamps,

506
00:30:23,332 --> 00:30:25,333
but it'll keep
the baby ones out.

507
00:30:27,336 --> 00:30:29,771
Get off my land.

508
00:30:29,806 --> 00:30:32,975
Good to see you're still
a son of a bitch, Herveaux.

509
00:30:33,009 --> 00:30:34,710
<i>I come out here</i>
<i>out of respect</i>

510
00:30:34,745 --> 00:30:36,579
for a man I once knew.

511
00:30:36,613 --> 00:30:39,048
No good deed goes
unpunished, I guess.

512
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:43,953
You were a Packmaster,

513
00:30:43,987 --> 00:30:45,821
<i>but you threw it all away.</i>

514
00:30:45,856 --> 00:30:48,357
I was forced out
by you turncoats.

515
00:30:50,894 --> 00:30:53,797
Don't let your old man
drag you down, Alcide.

516
00:30:53,831 --> 00:30:55,965
He's quicksand.

517
00:31:02,106 --> 00:31:04,240
Rollins is a lying shit.

518
00:31:04,275 --> 00:31:07,443
Comes out here acting
all high and mighty.

519
00:31:07,477 --> 00:31:09,512
He can go to hell.

520
00:31:09,546 --> 00:31:12,481
Can't trust him,
that's the truth.

521
00:31:15,885 --> 00:31:17,252
You did it.

522
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:20,088
So why don't we just stop
pretending like you didn't?

523
00:31:20,123 --> 00:31:22,357
You stole that money
from the pack.

524
00:31:22,392 --> 00:31:24,526
That's why
they kicked you out.

525
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,661
And there ain't a damn thing
you can do to change that.

526
00:31:26,695 --> 00:31:28,496
I don't need Rollins
coming out here

527
00:31:28,531 --> 00:31:30,899
digging up
ancient history.

528
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:33,735
And I sure as hell
don't need my kid

529
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:36,905
passing judgment.

530
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:39,307
You get it?

531
00:31:39,342 --> 00:31:41,943
Whatever happened
to pack first?

532
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,882
Pack left me
out here to rot.

533
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:50,318
Pack can go
fuck themselves.

534
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:08,235
Listen to me!

535
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:11,638
Russell Edgington is gonna
keep coming for me.

536
00:32:11,672 --> 00:32:13,473
He's not gonna stop.

537
00:32:13,507 --> 00:32:16,776
And after he's gotten me,
he's gonna come for you.

538
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,645
Now, I don't know about you guys,
but I am tired of running.

539
00:32:19,713 --> 00:32:22,248
We have to fight him,

540
00:32:22,282 --> 00:32:25,284
all of us together.

541
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:28,354
I'm sorry.
It's suicide.

542
00:32:28,388 --> 00:32:31,289
And yet we must.

543
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,563
We, the fairy tribe
of Bon Temps,

544
00:32:37,597 --> 00:32:41,133
in this plane,
in this time,

545
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:45,571
will fight with you,
Sookie Stackhouse.

546
00:32:52,712 --> 00:32:55,580
You clear on the plan?
Just be honest.

547
00:32:55,615 --> 00:32:57,548
Tell the truth.

548
00:32:57,583 --> 00:32:59,650
No, I won't have
to tell the truth.

549
00:32:59,684 --> 00:33:01,719
- 'Cause I'm gonna kill him.
- You don't have to do that.

550
00:33:01,753 --> 00:33:04,021
You could just
stay here with me.

551
00:33:04,055 --> 00:33:06,490
No, I want to do it.

552
00:33:06,524 --> 00:33:09,192
Sook, if there's
one thing I learned

553
00:33:09,226 --> 00:33:11,728
from my time as QB-1,

554
00:33:11,762 --> 00:33:15,432
it's that the best defense
is a good offense.

555
00:33:15,466 --> 00:33:18,734
So no more pussyfooting
around Russell.

556
00:33:20,638 --> 00:33:22,272
It's game time.

557
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,782
I love you.

558
00:33:33,286 --> 00:33:34,887
I love you, too, Sook.

559
00:33:42,161 --> 00:33:43,562
You give him hell.

560
00:33:43,596 --> 00:33:46,165
I always do.

561
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,440
Hey, y'all.
Here you go.

562
00:33:57,709 --> 00:33:59,143
- Come here.
- Oh!

563
00:33:59,178 --> 00:34:01,913
Terry Bellefleur, you're gonna get
me in trouble.

564
00:34:01,947 --> 00:34:03,214
Sam's not even around.

565
00:34:03,248 --> 00:34:05,583
Yeah, but Lafayette
is a snitch.

566
00:34:05,618 --> 00:34:07,785
I'm a bitch,
not a snitch.

567
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,688
Love it.

568
00:34:10,722 --> 00:34:13,157
I'm so glad to see
y'all back and happy

569
00:34:13,192 --> 00:34:16,560
and, you know,
in love and all.

570
00:34:16,594 --> 00:34:19,028
Thank you, cuz.
I appreciate that.

571
00:34:20,097 --> 00:34:22,498
She saves my life
every day.

572
00:34:22,532 --> 00:34:25,434
How do you make it last
for the long haul?

573
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:28,003
Well...

574
00:34:28,037 --> 00:34:29,872
I think it starts
with trust.

575
00:34:29,906 --> 00:34:31,973
- Trust most of all.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

576
00:34:32,008 --> 00:34:34,309
<i>And honesty.</i>
<i>Got to have honesty.</i>

577
00:34:34,343 --> 00:34:36,544
- Yeah, that, too.
- And loyalty.

578
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:38,452
You got to know that person's
gonna be there for you

579
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:39,447
through thick and thin

580
00:34:39,448 --> 00:34:42,283
'cause you never know
when some Iraqi ghost lady

581
00:34:42,318 --> 00:34:44,586
is gonna curse
your entire family.

582
00:34:46,155 --> 00:34:48,857
There you are.

583
00:34:48,891 --> 00:34:51,960
Maurella,
what are you doing here?

584
00:34:52,027 --> 00:34:53,962
There's danger
afoot, Andrew.

585
00:34:55,331 --> 00:34:58,233
You swore on the light
to protect me

586
00:34:58,268 --> 00:35:01,804
and the fruit of our union.

587
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:03,139
Andy Bellefleur!

588
00:35:03,173 --> 00:35:06,476
<i>Did you put that bun</i>
<i>in her oven?</i>

589
00:35:08,078 --> 00:35:12,082
But I just saw you
about a week ago,

590
00:35:12,116 --> 00:35:13,884
and you weren't pregnant.

591
00:35:13,918 --> 00:35:15,986
That was the night
we conceived.

592
00:35:16,021 --> 00:35:17,822
One week ago,
and now you're...

593
00:35:17,856 --> 00:35:20,825
Yes.
Right on schedule.

594
00:35:20,859 --> 00:35:22,927
Look, Maurella, you seem
like a lovely person.

595
00:35:22,961 --> 00:35:25,096
Mmm, I am.

596
00:35:25,131 --> 00:35:27,565
- And I know that we have--
- Twice.

597
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,601
But I'm not stupid.

598
00:35:29,635 --> 00:35:32,937
A lot of people might think I'm stupid,
but those people are wrong.

599
00:35:32,972 --> 00:35:36,074
No, I don't think
you're stupid.

600
00:35:36,108 --> 00:35:37,776
Well, apparently you do

601
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:40,011
if you think you can
pull this over on me.

602
00:35:40,046 --> 00:35:43,348
Did you or did you not
swear upon the light?

603
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:46,351
All I know is your finger
lit up and I touched it.

604
00:35:46,386 --> 00:35:49,721
You accepted
my light into you.

605
00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:52,525
Otherwise I never would
have shared flesh with you.

606
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:55,094
Twice.

607
00:35:55,129 --> 00:35:57,197
But I can't--

608
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:00,433
I got a good thing
starting with Holly.

609
00:36:00,468 --> 00:36:02,703
And I just feel
more comfortable

610
00:36:02,737 --> 00:36:05,038
with somebody
who's the same species.

611
00:36:06,407 --> 00:36:09,276
To ignore the light pact
will bring great dishonor

612
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:12,346
upon me and all my clan.

613
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:15,883
It is an act of war.

614
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:22,090
Bill-- I've never
seen him like that.

615
00:36:22,124 --> 00:36:26,026
He was cold, cruel even.

616
00:36:26,061 --> 00:36:28,395
That's nest behavior.

617
00:36:29,898 --> 00:36:32,733
When vampires live together
for a long time

618
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:34,467
and feed off
of each other's blood,

619
00:36:34,502 --> 00:36:36,603
they form a nest

620
00:36:36,637 --> 00:36:39,072
and become sadistic
and crazy.

621
00:36:39,106 --> 00:36:42,409
From what you're telling me,
drinking that Lilith's blood

622
00:36:42,443 --> 00:36:44,812
is making them
into a nest on steroids.

623
00:36:44,846 --> 00:36:46,513
Have you ever been
in a nest?

624
00:36:46,548 --> 00:36:48,515
Eric and I have
steered clear.

625
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:52,085
I find most vampires
as irritating as most humans.

626
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:54,020
Are you worried about Eric?

627
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:57,926
He's a big boy.
He can take care of himself.

628
00:36:58,861 --> 00:37:01,663
Well, thank you again

629
00:37:01,697 --> 00:37:03,298
for letting me stay here.

630
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:06,569
Totally. Maybe later we can braid
each other's hair

631
00:37:06,604 --> 00:37:08,238
and talk about boys.

632
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,108
Fucking baby vamps.

633
00:37:15,413 --> 00:37:18,381
She's all bark,
isn't she?

634
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:21,651
Nah, she's a lot
of bark

635
00:37:21,685 --> 00:37:23,820
and a lot of bite.

636
00:37:27,157 --> 00:37:28,758
Do you like her?

637
00:37:28,792 --> 00:37:30,059
What?

638
00:37:30,094 --> 00:37:32,128
You know, like...

639
00:37:32,162 --> 00:37:33,896
like, like her.

640
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:35,398
No.

641
00:37:35,432 --> 00:37:37,299
Why would you even
say something like that?

642
00:37:37,367 --> 00:37:38,834
I'm just asking.

643
00:37:38,869 --> 00:37:41,270
I don't know that many people of
the gay persuasion.

644
00:37:41,304 --> 00:37:43,238
It just looked like maybe you two
were getting along.

645
00:37:43,272 --> 00:37:45,240
I'm sorry, but you have no idea
what you're talking about.

646
00:37:45,274 --> 00:37:47,208
I didn't say that I did.
That's why I was asking.

647
00:37:47,243 --> 00:37:48,876
Pam and me--
never gonna happen.

648
00:37:48,911 --> 00:37:51,412
Okay. Fine.
Sorry I asked.

649
00:37:51,446 --> 00:37:54,415
Why you feel the need to get
all up in my business?

650
00:37:57,252 --> 00:37:59,821
'Cause I don't have
any friends.

651
00:37:59,855 --> 00:38:01,289
I don't have anyone
to talk to.

652
00:38:01,323 --> 00:38:03,724
<i>And even if you</i>
<i>freak out</i>

653
00:38:03,758 --> 00:38:05,793
<i>and go crazy now and again</i>
<i>and beat me up,</i>

654
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:08,796
I'm a vampire now,
so I heal.

655
00:38:08,831 --> 00:38:10,832
And I like
talking to you.

656
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:15,404
I'll try and bring you
a fangbanger later.

657
00:38:17,207 --> 00:38:18,875
Thanks.

658
00:38:56,147 --> 00:38:57,680
We're all out
of Tru Blood.

659
00:38:57,748 --> 00:38:59,982
What else you serving?

660
00:39:00,016 --> 00:39:02,084
You're welcome to try
your luck with this fine

661
00:39:02,118 --> 00:39:04,653
cross section of humanity.

662
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:07,856
I'm looking for someone.
My progeny.

663
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:09,391
He's sheriff of these parts.

664
00:39:09,425 --> 00:39:12,360
Came by here last night.

665
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:15,229
We paid our taxes
and he moved on.

666
00:39:15,263 --> 00:39:17,431
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah.

667
00:39:17,466 --> 00:39:19,133
Ah!

668
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:21,669
I can smell
Elijah's blood on you.

669
00:39:21,703 --> 00:39:24,438
A maker always knows

670
00:39:24,506 --> 00:39:27,174
when her progeny dies.

671
00:39:27,209 --> 00:39:29,310
He was only one
of 204,

672
00:39:29,344 --> 00:39:32,479
but it's still like
a cold spike in your heart.

673
00:39:33,715 --> 00:39:36,584
Who killed him?
Was it you?

674
00:39:36,618 --> 00:39:38,552
<i>It was me.</i>

675
00:39:40,755 --> 00:39:43,723
What possessed you

676
00:39:43,758 --> 00:39:45,358
to murder my progeny?

677
00:39:45,393 --> 00:39:48,895
He was getting
on my nerves.

678
00:39:51,631 --> 00:39:54,533
In the name of the one
true Vampire Authority,

679
00:39:54,567 --> 00:39:57,970
in whose wisdom and justice
all is made manifest by Lilith,

680
00:39:58,004 --> 00:40:03,542
I arrest you for the murder
of Sheriff Elijah Stormer.

681
00:40:19,193 --> 00:40:21,194
Your daddy
is looking for you.

682
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:35,576
<i>Bill Compton.</i>

683
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,050
<i>Only one can lead us.</i>

684
00:40:44,085 --> 00:40:46,053
I choose you.

685
00:40:51,993 --> 00:40:54,161
I'm not worthy.

686
00:40:56,197 --> 00:40:58,565
Drink of me.

687
00:41:00,201 --> 00:41:03,403
Drink all of me.

688
00:41:38,441 --> 00:41:39,875
<i>He's all over the guy.</i>

689
00:41:39,909 --> 00:41:42,778
He's hanging all over the fucking guy,
you blind prick!

690
00:41:42,813 --> 00:41:45,281
Whoo-hoo!

691
00:41:46,717 --> 00:41:48,719
- Yeah.
- Ah! Fuckin' A!

692
00:41:49,854 --> 00:41:51,455
Fuckin' A.

693
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:53,457
I'm healing.

694
00:41:53,492 --> 00:41:55,626
<i>- Don't go out there.</i>
<i>- Ah! Ah!</i>

695
00:41:58,863 --> 00:42:00,731
They're heading over
to the Reeves place.

696
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:03,334
You always got to be
the fuckin' hero.

697
00:42:03,368 --> 00:42:05,669
You raised me to be
a man and a wolf,

698
00:42:05,704 --> 00:42:07,238
not a thief and a coward.

699
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:33,331
Jesus!

700
00:42:33,365 --> 00:42:35,033
I actually met him.

701
00:42:35,067 --> 00:42:38,503
He was a boring hippie
who stank of patchouli.

702
00:42:39,772 --> 00:42:41,640
Hi, Jason.

703
00:42:41,675 --> 00:42:43,042
Oh, look.

704
00:42:43,076 --> 00:42:45,644
We got ourselves
a hunk sandwich.

705
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:47,179
Get your fucking
hands off me.

706
00:42:47,214 --> 00:42:49,015
- Get off me!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

707
00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:50,349
Where's your sister?

708
00:42:50,384 --> 00:42:52,519
Yeah, you ain't never
gonna find her.

709
00:42:52,553 --> 00:42:54,254
'Cause she's someplace
you can't get in.

710
00:42:54,288 --> 00:42:56,423
And where might that be?

711
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:59,059
She's with the fairies.

712
00:42:59,961 --> 00:43:01,562
What fairies?

713
00:43:01,597 --> 00:43:03,298
There's a bunch of them.

714
00:43:03,332 --> 00:43:05,801
They got a club
out by the Thibodeaux Farm.

715
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:12,274
How about you lead us to
this spritely smorgasbord?

716
00:43:12,308 --> 00:43:13,809
Okay.

717
00:43:13,843 --> 00:43:15,377
Stay just like that
until we find her.

718
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:17,512
Oh, you bet.

719
00:43:17,547 --> 00:43:19,414
Who knows how to
show you a good time?

720
00:43:19,448 --> 00:43:20,648
You do.

721
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:22,183
- Whoo-hoo!
- Come out here!

722
00:43:22,217 --> 00:43:25,754
- <i>We're not gonna hurt ya.</i>
- We're just gonna eat ya.

723
00:43:25,788 --> 00:43:28,223
- Let's flip this fucker.
- Leave her be!

724
00:43:31,861 --> 00:43:33,628
When we die, we're goo?

725
00:43:33,663 --> 00:43:35,330
You're already dead.

726
00:43:42,139 --> 00:43:44,240
Twist his head off!

727
00:43:45,676 --> 00:43:47,410
<i>Motherfucker.</i>

728
00:43:49,113 --> 00:43:51,449
No!

729
00:44:11,269 --> 00:44:12,903
- Emma?
<i>- Oh, shit.</i>

730
00:44:12,937 --> 00:44:14,237
What the fuck
kind of monsters are you?

731
00:44:17,608 --> 00:44:19,809
Oh, my God.
Hey there, baby.

732
00:44:19,843 --> 00:44:22,045
You're fine.
Just don't shift.

733
00:44:22,913 --> 00:44:24,814
We have to hurry.

734
00:44:24,849 --> 00:44:26,950
What the fuck are you
doing out?

735
00:44:28,118 --> 00:44:30,820
- Shift.
- I'm not gonna leave her.

736
00:44:30,854 --> 00:44:32,188
We won't.

737
00:44:32,222 --> 00:44:34,623
Chancellor Compton
is requesting his breakfast.

738
00:44:34,657 --> 00:44:37,125
Hey, wait.

739
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,560
I'll go.

740
00:44:38,594 --> 00:44:41,129
That's a first.
You in a hurry to die?

741
00:44:41,164 --> 00:44:42,697
Just as soon
get it over with.

742
00:44:42,732 --> 00:44:45,033
Do whatever you have to!

743
00:44:45,067 --> 00:44:47,035
Sam!

744
00:45:06,123 --> 00:45:07,757
Chancellor?

745
00:45:12,095 --> 00:45:14,897
Lilith came to me.

746
00:45:17,234 --> 00:45:18,901
She chose me.

747
00:45:22,439 --> 00:45:23,906
No.

748
00:45:25,275 --> 00:45:27,009
She chose me!

749
00:45:34,817 --> 00:45:37,818
Take her to the cells.

750
00:45:37,853 --> 00:45:41,322
Chelsea, will you please
page Chancellor Compton?

751
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:50,698
What the fuck
are you doing here?

752
00:45:50,733 --> 00:45:53,768
What are you doing here?
Hey, help Luna!

753
00:45:53,803 --> 00:45:56,138
Who the fuck is Luna?

754
00:45:56,172 --> 00:45:57,973
Fuck you!

755
00:46:02,378 --> 00:46:05,747
<i>Chancellor Compton,</i>

756
00:46:05,782 --> 00:46:08,516
<i>your progeny will meet you</i>
<i>in the main chamber.</i>

757
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:23,363
What do you have
to say for yourself?

758
00:46:23,398 --> 00:46:25,933
I'm sorry.

759
00:46:27,035 --> 00:46:29,236
I just--

760
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:31,071
when I got there,
Jason wasn't into it.

761
00:46:31,105 --> 00:46:32,606
I didn't think
it was right.

762
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,577
So you decided it would be better
to kill two vampires instead?

763
00:46:36,611 --> 00:46:40,046
That security guy,
he was gonna make me turn him.

764
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:43,583
He was doing his job--
following my orders.

765
00:46:43,617 --> 00:46:46,185
You chose a human
over two vampires.

766
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,520
He's not a human.
He's Jason.

767
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:50,222
You staked Longshadow
for Sookie.

768
00:46:50,256 --> 00:46:53,024
Lilith commands that vampire
hath dominion over human.

769
00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:54,926
Who cares about Lilith?

770
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,462
Pam says you are in a nest
and it is making you crazy.

771
00:47:00,065 --> 00:47:02,933
Who are you
to defy me?

772
00:47:03,969 --> 00:47:06,737
I am the chosen one!

773
00:47:06,805 --> 00:47:08,940
Lilith chose me!

774
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:19,318
Only one can lead us.

775
00:47:19,352 --> 00:47:21,620
I choose you.

776
00:47:21,654 --> 00:47:23,722
<i>Drink of me.</i>

777
00:47:23,756 --> 00:47:26,859
Drink all of me.

778
00:47:34,734 --> 00:47:36,602
Baby, let me out.

779
00:47:36,636 --> 00:47:39,038
Baby, open the door.

780
00:47:43,977 --> 00:47:46,512
What is that smell?

781
00:47:46,546 --> 00:47:48,915
Fairy.

782
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,950
Where are they?

783
00:47:50,984 --> 00:47:53,486
Right there.

784
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,154
Where?

785
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:58,257
There.

786
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:01,761
- That smell.
- Where are they?

787
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:05,098
I can feel them.
They're all around me.

788
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:08,501
What fucking
fairy magic is this?

789
00:48:10,904 --> 00:48:13,239
Where are they?

790
00:48:16,009 --> 00:48:18,578
Oh, mercy!

791
00:48:29,057 --> 00:48:31,726
- What are you waiting for?
- We're ready to fight.

792
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,195
Jason brought them here.
That was the plan.

793
00:48:34,229 --> 00:48:35,997
The plan has changed.

794
00:48:36,031 --> 00:48:38,566
Where are you, fairy?

795
00:48:38,601 --> 00:48:40,736
Sookie Stackhouse,
I will tear your brother

796
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:42,604
limb from limb unless
you show yourself.

797
00:48:42,638 --> 00:48:44,406
We have to fight them.

798
00:48:45,808 --> 00:48:47,843
I'm not letting you out there
to get yourselves killed.

799
00:48:47,877 --> 00:48:51,045
- You said we were--
- Don't worry. I got this.

800
00:48:51,981 --> 00:48:54,949
Sookie Stackhouse!

801
00:48:55,818 --> 00:48:57,618
Oh...

802
00:49:00,623 --> 00:49:03,558
As I live and breathe.

803
00:49:03,592 --> 00:49:05,059
A fairy.

804
00:49:05,094 --> 00:49:07,395
Ah!

805
00:49:13,502 --> 00:49:15,002
Impressive.

806
00:49:15,037 --> 00:49:17,572
You are turbocharged.

807
00:49:20,442 --> 00:49:25,646
Vampire, I hereby banish you
to the realms and beyond.

808
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,082
Begone!

809
00:49:28,116 --> 00:49:30,017
Jason!

810
00:49:31,486 --> 00:49:33,354
Jason.

811
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:35,856
I said begone.

812
00:49:50,839 --> 00:49:55,842
Oh, sweet
merciful fuck!

813
00:49:55,877 --> 00:49:58,212
That was delicious!

814
00:49:58,246 --> 00:50:01,715
Heaven, thy name

815
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:04,952
is fairy.

816
00:50:13,796 --> 00:50:16,898
Oh, God.
He can see us.

817
00:50:16,932 --> 00:50:20,335
Why, thank you so much.

818
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:25,373
I'd love to come
to dinner.
